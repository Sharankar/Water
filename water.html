<hr>
<p>Water is constantly moving on the Earth between the atmosphere, ocean, rivers and streams, snowpacks and ice sheets, and underground</p>
<p>. Water availability, both as surface water and groundwater, is essential for agriculture, human consumption, industry, and energy generation.</p>
<p>Water supply is the provision of water by public utilities, commercial organisations, community endeavors or by individuals, usually via a system of pumps and pipes.</p>
<p> Aspects of service quality include continuity of supply, water quality and water pressure.</p>
<p> The institutional responsibility for water supply is arranged differently in different countries and regions </p>
<p> It usually includes issues surrounding policy and regulation, service provision and standardization.</p>
